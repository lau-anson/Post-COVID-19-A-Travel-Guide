## Post Covid-19: A Travel Guide

Contributors: Alex Nguyen, Anson Lau, Daniel Kaloshi, Dua Hussain

This is our course project for CSC 111: Foundations of Computer Science II .

We developed a system that recommends the user the safest layover flight(s) to take based on a layover country's 
COVID-19  levels, if a direct flight does not exist. Users are also able to access a world map detailing the danger 
levels of each country in terms of COVID-19.

Please access our Course Project Report for further details.
